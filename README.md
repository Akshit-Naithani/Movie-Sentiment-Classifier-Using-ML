# Movie-Sentiment-Classifier-Using-ML
Python program to classify movies reviews as positive or negative. It uses a Multinomial Naive bayes classifier to classify reviews based on the words recognized in the reviews.
It is computationally simple and easy to understand. I used the IMDB Dataset from kaggle, split it and used it to train and as well as test the model. At the end it provides the
accuracy of the model. With sklearn's classification package, you could get the summary of the moodel's performance. Run the model.py file in a python enviorment. Remember to change 
the location of the dataset in the code to the location of your dataset.
